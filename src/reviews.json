But the readings are great, and even though the comments seem like a lot of work you'll get used it and be a better writer for them. You'll have to write a mid-term essay, but they give you the prompt well in advance. Saying this makes me question my entire existence but I actually enjoyed writing the essay. The end sem is creative group project, which is also fun if you're doing it with people you like. You won't get great grades if you don't actually work of them, but the TFs give meaningful feedback so you can actually improve. The attendance policy is strict, they tell you at the very beginning that you can miss only so many classes and so many prompts, and then cut some of your grade for absences beyond that. But the prof is great and the lectures are so much fun. I'm planning on doing a Lit minor just because I enjoyed this course so much.",

The TFs are nice and they're trying their best, but nothing can save this course tbh. My TF was Saurabh and his connection issues are so severe that 70% of the DS is spent waiting for him to join back. There's quite a few quizzes, and they get harder as the sem progresses. I'm pretty sure there is an attendance policy but no one follows it. So just do yourself a favor- if math isn't your favorite subject,  you are not gonna sail through this course. ",

Now I had heard that the course was very well organised online, but for us the 250 and 500-word papers were a bit of a mess.

      "review": "This was supposed to be a foundation course. I am genuinely terrified of maths and don't see a point in doing it again in college however out of all QRMT options this seemed the best because it was different and I have no background in computers but I always interested in knowing more. The professor is amazing and the course is different and nice. However the way it is structured is unnecessarily heave and demoralizing for people like who dont understand shit no matter how hard you try and that's okay too. You get some and you dont get the rest. But for an FC it is way too demanding and time consuming and pointlessly complicated. I love rewatching the lectures and revisiting them to understand concepts better but how do you expect me to draw connections in a short span of time when you conveniently forget I have other courses too?I genuinely loved the theory content for this course but I ended up burnt out, low on self confidence, miserable and exhausted by the end of it. My other FCs suffered. No matter how much effort I put to work for this course it seems to go wasted. It got mentally draining in a bad way. Can you please focus on remembering someone of us don't know shit about computers and your firehose method just might result in me drowning under so much of it. Like the professor said, when you look back at the day you started and where you are now I've come a long way and it is amazing but I would never recommend this to anyone ever for the sheer reason that when you make it so drilling and intense it sucks the fun out of it and missed the whole point. This isn't about the grade drop also, its about the journey which you wish just came to an end by the end of it. The prof also said he doesnt believe in the concept of exams and exams are 50 percent of our grade. I got to learn so much but when people who know CS can just figure things out that you just cant and then everyone has moved to the next topic it gets weird. Chill out on the course structure. Give more psets I have learnt more by sitting with my peers and working on understanding and doing the psets than anything else. Puzzle day was crazy but still rewarding. It's a good course but I dont see a point to it till you restructure the way it should be conducted.. Before taking this course everyone told me Debayan is worth it. I'd agree Debayan is amazing but not the FC. I will definitely keep up with all the new concepts I learnt theory wise and will take up python in the future too all because of Debayan but honestly not for a good long time and the way this FC is structured is to blame. Also for apple's sake please make fixed DS. All the TFs are amazing but they have such distinct ways of teaching you end up way more confused than sorted by the end of it. I am sorry for this long rant but I have cried way too much in this course to not say this out loud. I will gladly work through pain and Debayan makes me want to but it's just too much and not worth it. Limit topics and tests please. And remember some of us just suck at math in general an answer involving trigo in its explanation that too applied is killing. And trust me I gave this course everything I got and the reason I got worked up is because despite all of it I just couldn't perform in exams. Just couldnt get the questions  lastly I'll just like to say the first class with Debayan assured me this was one of my best decisions by far and by the last class it was all toppled over. I can assure you there are many like me whether they say it here or not who feel the same. We want to love this experience like all the others in this course but please give me a chance to be able to do that because right now it's just not doing it for me. I am dumb when it comes to QRMT and I am self aware enough to know that  I am ready to push myself for it too but if you are forcing me to do it then please don't make it more difficult than my 12 years of school math trauma and more. I have nothing against anyone honestly this is just my POV and I was extremely miserable so I wanted to put it out there . I didnt take an easy collaborative math course because this was different. Dont make others afraid to do this like I am now because of such experiences. ",

So, the interaction with the professor was minimal. The grades depend on your TF, and one of the TFs was a highly absent one and would take ages to give grades, however, one other was great, and the third one gave strict grades, but was overall nice. However, this course is an engaging one, and you'll love it, if you're willing to put in effort. There are bi-weekly readings which are usually long, on which we have to leave comments which are graded by a system, and there are papers we have to write. In my case, the professor completely went MIA, because he was sick, and wasn't responding to anybody's emails, so one of our papers was cancelled, and a lot of confusion was caused due to that. But, overall, i still love this course, maybe it's just because my Tf is lenient, but its a good course. ",

The one problem is that grading is extremely slow. It\u2019s December and we still haven\u2019t gotten our grades for the midterm paper yet. The course is also not the most organised, which stressed me out a little, but it wasn\u2019t too bad. They\u2019re just very laid back and flexible on dates (not due dates though. Get your stuff in on time). Other than that, its a nice course with engaging lectures. There\u2019s a decent amount of work but it\u2019s light, so very manageable.",

Really challenging (and sometimes frustrating) and takes up the entire duration (we had 48 hours). You need a good team for puzzle day. Can get stressful if you have other exams due on the same weekend. But overall great experience and the hints session that debayan holds makes it all worth it.\n\nThis is not a math intensive (or math-y in the slightest sense) at all. \n\nWould 100/10 tell you this is not a course to miss.

The workload is a little on the higher side but manageable. You get 4-6 problem sets on average throughout the course + mid sem and end sem exam + puzzle day. The course structure is very very interesting and engaging, everybody loves it. The only thing that made me regret taking this course was the exams. They're like 200 marks papers for 90 mins - pretty damn tough and it's very easy to flunk them. But Debayan gives many extra credit stuff to help you get a better grade. Also, it might be quite complex and intimidating for non CS students but if I managed (PCB Student), you will too. Overall, I'd totally recommend this course, it's been one of a kind experience.",

He is really sweet but his teaching style is quite abstract which is not something I personally prefer. The workload is pretty low as it's only mid sem and end sem essays. Although the readings might get a bit too much depending upon your TF. I had Heeral and she is an excellent TF except that she asks to read a bit too much.",

Then surprisingly the second TF grade mine for IDK what reason and cut marks on those same points and that the other TF agreed was okay. I could not appeal either. I really hope the TF gets kicked out of Ashoka. Ruined my GPA for no reason. Absolute dogshit piece of garbage TF. The people from this class reading this know who I'm talking about.

The advantage of taking this course is that you get a chance to build a great personal rapport with the Professor and make some really good friends because of the really small class size. The course encourages collaborations and discussions. Professor would be happy to give you a lot of extensions. It is up to you to decide on how you plan to manage the work load.

The OAA has incorrectly mentioned Professor Bhatia as offering this course on the AMS. I would strongly recommend that you take this course offered by Professor Sourav Ghosh. There will be 4 assignments plus a bonus assignment. You are allowed to discuss these assignments with anybody, including the TFs. WARNING: DISCUSSION IS ALLOWED, COPYING SOMEBODY ELSE'S ANSWERS IS NOT ALLOWED. The course had take home exams. A very important thing to keep in mind is that if you do not understand something, please interrupt and tell the Professor that you do not understand it. Do not hesitate. Keeping quiet would be a big mistake. It is perfectly okay to not even attend a single lecture for this course. All lectures are recorded, and there are no restrictions on access to the lecture recordings. However, my suggestion would be to not bunk lectures and be regular. This will help you. Also, all assignments and exams have bonus questions. Do not leave questions, even if you are confident of getting 100 percent. You must attempt all of them. This course is to be enjoyed. ",
